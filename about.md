I'm **Jim Counts**, an independent DevOps and cloud engineer. I specialize in **Azure**, **Terraform**, **CI/CD**, and building **secure, automated infrastructure** that helps teams ship faster—and sleep better.

This blog, **Cloud as Code**, is where I share what I’ve learned building and operating cloud-native systems. Expect practical tips, deep dives, and the occasional rant about configuration drift.

When I'm not writing code or infrastructure policies, I'm probably writing about them.
